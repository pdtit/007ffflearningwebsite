      <description>You might get amazed, finding out I managed to publish yet another book, where the previous one Efficiently Migrating your workloads to Azure only got published around Christmas.
However, this new one was a &amp;ldquo;longer work in progress&amp;rdquo;, and not something I could spew out in just a few weeks.
Several months ago, I got approached by Packt Publishing, asking me to &amp;ldquo;write a quick note on how I look at Azure strategic implementation and migration&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>
