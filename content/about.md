# Microsoft Azure Readiness Starts Here...

# Peter De Tender
I am an **Azure Technical Trainer (ATT)** for the EMEA region at **Microsoft**. Out of this role, I provide Azure readiness workshops to larger Microsoft customers and partners, skilling up their Azure knowledge.


Before taking on this position, I was already an Azure trainer and cloud solution architect out of my own business, for the last 5 years. I decided to keep the domain name for obvious reasons, and will continue providing Azure readiness content here, or at user group events and other conferences as speaker.


I am a Microsoft Certified Trainer since 2010 (officially, but trained already before).


I was recognized as a Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable Professional) since 2013, initially on Windows IT Pro, but switched to Azure from 2015-2019.


Since 2011, I am the chairman for EMEA of the IAMCT (International Association of Microsoft Certified Trainers), a global community of MCT's, outside of Microsoft Learning.

I'm married for +22 years with my loving wife Els, and am the proud father of 2 wonderful girls, Kaylee, 20y, studying Law in the USA, and Kitana, 15y, hoping to go study in South Korea soon. Our family recently expanded, since we adopted a 5 month old kitten, named Spot.
